##User Stories:
* As a developer I would like to create a streamlined webpage that organizes the images data into an object. I then would use that data to produce an output based on our user's choices.
* As a employer I would like to see the images in random orders every time I load the page keeping the page interesting every time a potential customer visits our page.
* As a employer I would like the images to all be scaled to a common size and scaleable based on the screen's resolution.
* As a user I would like a nice CSS layout on the front page to keep me engaged in playing the "game."
* As a coworker I would like a nice organization of the files and comments throughout the code explaining functions.
